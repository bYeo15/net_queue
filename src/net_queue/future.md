--- Arbitrary msg packing (unify JOB & RESP)
--- Figure out worker counts (order vs STATUS msg)
    --- STATUS message
- Local queue for server put (as opposed to failing)
    - ie. Local "waiting to be sent" queue as well as "waiting to be received"
    - Pair with below thread?
- Message recv error handling (timeout on recv to ensure half-sent messages don't create a block)
- Distinct thread for polling, etc. (run separate from main process?)
- Better connection logic
- Handle errors, disconnects, etc. better
- Config file
    - Format (TOML, JSON?)
    - Properties
    - Auto-bind, accept (server) and connect (client)
