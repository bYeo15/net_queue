- Message recv error handling (timeout on recv to ensure half-sent messages don't create a block)
- Distinct thread for polling, etc. (run separate from main process?)
    - Similar thread for accepting connections
    - Alternative: `asyncio`?
- Better connection logic
- Handle errors, disconnects, etc. better
    - Catch common network exceptions
